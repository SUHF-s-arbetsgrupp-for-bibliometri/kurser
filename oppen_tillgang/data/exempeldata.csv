PMID,IDENTIFIED DATA STATEMENT 
24068705,whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and gene expression data have been submitted to the ncbi gene expression omnibus (geo; http://www ncbi nlm nih gov/geo/ ) under accession number gse49629.   remarkably there was a dramatic change in large regions of the genome with 10565 large-scale blocks of hypomethylation encompassing 2 18 gb of the genome of which 485 were longer than 1 mb ( fig 2a ; supplemental data 1).;     overlap of blocks with genomic domains we then searched for large-scale dna methylation differences between activated and quiescent cells and found hypomethylated blocks encompassing 60 7 mb of the genome with the largest block being just under 95 kb (supplemental data 1).;     in total we identified 2970 small dmrs of which 1502 were hypermethylated and 1468 were hypomethylated following ebv transformation (supplemental data 2).;     we then looked for methylation differences between quiescent and activated b-cells and identified 1014 small dmrs associated with activation (supplemental data 2).;     comparing ebv transformed and activated cells we identified 1769 genes to be differentially expressed above background with a fold change of two or greater (supplemental data 3).;     comparing activated and quiescent cells we found 4502 genes to be differentially expressed above background with a fold change of two or greater (supplemental data 3).
